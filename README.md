Welcome to the **Angular Host Application**! This project is the cornerstone of a modern microfrontend architecture that integrates a React remote application, secured by Keycloak, and communicates with a Node.js backend API.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository is your gateway to building scalable, secure, and modular web applications using the power of **Module Federation** and **Keycloak**. Here’s what this project offers:

- **Modular Architecture**: Leverage **Webpack Module Federation** to dynamically load and integrate remote React components.
- **Secure by Design**: Employ **Keycloak** for robust, centralized authentication across both Angular and React applications.
- **API Integration**: Seamlessly interact with a **Node.js backend** for data management and business logic.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **🔗 Module Federation**: Dynamically load and render remote React components within the Angular host.
- **🔐 Keycloak Authentication**: Centralized authentication and authorization across the microfrontend architecture.
- **📡 API Communication**: Securely communicate with a Node.js backend using access tokens from Keycloak.
